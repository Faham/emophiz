Using emotional responses to increase the level of users interaction with a real-time 
play technology requires an effective technique to identifying specific emotion 
states within an emotional space. Major existing emotion models in the
psychology literture includes: basic emotion theory ~\cite{ekman1992argument, ekman1992there} ,
dimensional emotion theory ~\cite{lang1995emotion, russell1980circumplex} and models 
from appraisal theory (e.g.,~\cite{roseman2001model}) ~\cite{zhang2010service}

Basic emotion theory identifes anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and 
surprise ~\cite{peter2006emotion} as the consice set of primary
emotions. These are actually the least six universal categories researchers agreed 
upon ~\cite{zagalo2004story}. It also claims these
primary emotions are distinguishable from each other and
other affective phenomena ~\cite{dalgleish1999handbook}. On the other hand dimensional 
emotion theory argues that all emotional states reside
in a two-dimensional space, defined by arousal and valence.

While there are various opinions on identifying emotional
states, classifcation into discrete emotions ~\cite{dalgleish1999handbook}, or locating
emotions along multiple axes ~\cite{russell1989affect, lang1995emotion}, both 
had limited success in using physiology to identify 
emotional states ~\cite{cacioppo2000psychophysiology}.

Lang used a 2-D space defined by arousal and valence (pleasure) (AV space) 
to classify emotions ~\cite{lang1995emotion}. Valence can be
described as a subjective feeling of pleasantness or unpleasantness while 
arousal is the subjective state feeling activated
or deactivated ~\cite{barrett1998discrete}. Using an arousal-valence space to create
the Affect Grid, Russell believed that arousal and valence
are cognitive dimentions of individual emotion states. Affect is a broad definition 
that includes feelings, moods, sentiments etc. and is commonly used to define the concept of
emotion ~\cite{picard2003affective}. Russell's circumplex model has two "axes"
that might be labeled as displeasure/pleasure (horizontal
axis) and low/high arousal (vertical axis) It is not easy to
map affective states into distinctive emotional states, However these models can 
provide a mapping between predefined
states and the level of arousal and valence ~\cite{zagalo2004story},

Both mentioned models for identifying emotions convey some
practical issues in emotion measurement. In a HCI context, the 
stimuli for potential emotions may vary less than
in human-human interaction (e.g., participant verbal expressions and body language) 
~\cite{zhang2010service} and also the combination of
evoked emotions ~\cite{peter2006emotion}. However with help of physiological
signals and the fuzzy logic in the model we are going to
use, such issues with our dimentional emotion models would
be minimized. Though it is anticipated to observe different range 
of evoked emotions while interacting with play
technologies compared to interacting with other humans in
daily life. ~\cite{zhang2010service}. However our dimensional emotion models
suffers some other problems. One problems is that arousal
and valence are not independent and one can impact the
other ~\cite{mandryk2007fuzzy}. Continuously capturing emotional experiences
in this applied setting is of its other halmarks. Subjective
measures based on dimensional emotion theory, such as the
Affect Grid ~\cite{russell1989affect} and the Self-Assessment 
Manikin ~\cite{bradley1994measuring}, allow
for quick assessments of user emotional experiences but they
may aggregate responses over the course of many events ~\cite{zhang2010service}.
This work uses Mandryk et al. version of AV space ~\cite{mandryk2007fuzzy}.

%%% and relate that to what we have done in this research

Playing video games for entertainment would help people to have new internal experiences. 
The virtual world of video games lets adults to play as new characters and enjoy filling 
their heads with throughts and emotions unrelated to their work or school. Some people value 
the sensation

Games are opportunities for development and design of environemnts therefore 
the player can interactively experience various emotions and mental conditions.
This interactive experience in contrast to movies 
and other major types of digital entertainment is what makes them exceptional
