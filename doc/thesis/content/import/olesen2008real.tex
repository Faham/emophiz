Computer game balance (or difficulty adjustment) is a
crucial aspect of commercial game development. Currently,
this is achieved either by predefined levels of game challenge
— the player then decides which of those levels she will play
against — or by techniques known as rubber-band artificial
intelligence (AI) [1], mainly used in racing games. The
first approach cannot incorporate the needs of all potential
players of the game while the latter approach generates
predictable behaviors which reduce the believability of the
non-player characters (NPCs). Furthermore, human players
enhance their skills while playing a game which necessitates
an adaptive mechanism that covers the player’s need for more
challenging NPCs during play (i.e. in real-time).
