Since computers are playing a significant role in our daily
life, the need for a more friendly and natural communication
interface between human and computer has continiously increased. 
Making computers capabale of perceiving the situation in terms 
of most human specific factors and responding
dependent to this perception is of major steps to acquire
this goal. If computers could recognize the situation the
same way as human does, they would be much more natural
to communicate.
Emotions are of important and mysterious human attributes
that have a great effect on people's day to day behavior. Researchs 
from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science,
suggests that emotion plays critical roles in rational and intelligent 
behavior ~\cite{picard2001toward}. Apparently, emotion interacts with
thinking in ways that are nonobvious but important for intelligent 
functioning ~\cite{picard2001toward}. Scientists have amassed evidence
that emotional skills are a basic component of intelligence,
especially for learning preferences and adapting to what is
important ~\cite{mayer1993intelligence, goleman2006emotional}
People used to express their emotions through facial expressions, 
body movement, gestures and tone of voice and expect
others understand and answer to their affective state. But
sometimes there is a distinction between inner emotional experiences 
and the outward emotional expressions ~\cite{picard2003affective}. Some
emotions can be hard to recognise by humans, and inner
emotional experiences may not be expressed outwardly ~\cite{jones2007biometric}.
Recent extensive investigations of physiological signals for
emotion detection have been providing encouraging results
where affective states are directly related to change in inner
bodily signals ~\cite{jones2007biometric}. However whether we can use physiological
patterns to recognise distinct emotions is still a 
question ~\cite{picard2001toward, cacioppo1990inferring}.

Although the study of affective computing has increased
considerably during the last years, few have applied their
research to play technologies ~\cite{sykes2003affective}. Emotional component of
human computer interaction in video games is surprisingly
important. Game players frequently turn to the console in
their search for an emotional experience ~\cite{rouse2010game}. There are
numerous benefits such technology could bring video game
experience, like: The ability to generate game content dynamically 
with respect to the affective state of the player,
the ability to communicate the affective state of the game
player to third parties and adoption of new game mechanics
based on the affective state of the player ~\cite{sykes2003affective}.
This work concentrates on developing a real-time emotion
recognition system for play technologies which can quantify
player instant emotional state during a play experience The
rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we outline 
different emotion recognition theories with an overview
of physiology sensors. In Section 3 we demonstrate some
implementation details of the system. We then describe the
experimental setup in Section 4 before giving our results in
Section 5. Finally, we give conclusions in Section 6.
