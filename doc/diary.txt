 downloaded and installed source sdk 2007 which is dependent to source sdk and source sdk 2006.
 bought half life 2 for enabling source skd 2007 mod mode for it, i intend to use that for 
my game testing experiment.

 after days of struggling with the stupid hammer editor I found out the way to get the editor running properly with no blank viewport for my mod under the source 2007 is to set the SteamAppId value to 218 under my gameinfo.txt at the mod directory under steam.
 
 use " sv_cheats 1" to enable cheats
 use "impulse 101" for all weapons and ammos
 use "ent_fire plyr_speed ModifySpeed 1.2" to change player speed
