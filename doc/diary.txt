 downloaded and installed source sdk 2007 which is dependent to source sdk and source sdk 2006.
 bought half life 2 for enabling source skd 2007 mod mode for it, i intend to use that for 
my game testing experiment.

 after days of struggling with the stupid hammer editor I found out the way to get the editor running properly with no blank viewport for my mod under the source 2007 is to set the SteamAppId value to 218 under my gameinfo.txt at the mod directory under steam.
 
 use "sv_cheats 1" to enable cheats
 use "impulse 101" for all weapons and ammos
 use "ent_fire plyr_speed ModifySpeed 1.2" to change player speed

 (meeting with regan, kevin)
 2 difficulty levels for both experienced and non-experienced players
 parameters to change:
	- number of spawn points
	- base spawn rate
 3 conditions each one around 5min. adaptive player, adaptive npc and adaptive environment
 (1) player: 
	- speed: regular and sprint standard should change
	- grenades: player can create grenades, one every ? seconds, and the rate of grenades creation can change.
	note: bullets should be weak enough to make it chanllenging, player has one infinite ammo machine gun which can launch grenades
 (2) npc:
	- zombie walking speed
	- zombie spawn rate
 (3) environment:
	- health packs rate, there is a vending machine that generates health packs with a defined rate.
	- light, levels lighting can go high or low based on players feedback.

 note: log everything into a csv file, there might be a 1 or 2 minutes training.

  (meeting with regan about piloting).
  - 2 minutes of calibration starting at the begining of round 1.
  - 5 minutes of rest between each condition during this time players should fill out questionares for each condition.
  - 6 people for piolting the experiment in 2 groups of 3.
  - we should still use the fuzzy approach though the arousal level is totally dependant to the GSR sensor.
  - the focus of the this research is relating game adaptation to affects and looks for the differences between the 3 adaptation condition.
  - questionaires to use: PENS for before each condition and PANAS and NASA-TLS for after each conditions. GEK is also a questionaire to look at.
  - the PENS should tell how players better played and how they tell the differences between the conditions.
  - the order of played conditions should be in a latin square order through different players, like the 1st player would player PL,NPC,ENV and the 2nd would player NPC,ENV,PL and the 3d ENV,PL,NPC.
  - the structure of the thesis looks alright the chapter 03 "Customizing Play Experience in Real-Time" should be removed and merged into intro and lit-review.
  - the chapter 04 "Implementation and Integration" should be splitted into two chapters, Implementation talks about the affect system and the Integration talks about the mod and game creation part.
  - each player needs to play for 7 minutes including the 2 minute calibration for each condition, after that they would finish by either dieing or ending the round.
