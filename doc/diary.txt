 downloaded and installed source sdk 2007 which is dependent to source sdk and source sdk 2006.
 bought half life 2 for enabling source skd 2007 mod mode for it, i intend to use that for 
my game testing experiment.

 after days of struggling with the stupid hammer editor I found out the way to get the editor running properly with no blank viewport for my mod under the source 2007 is to set the SteamAppId value to 218 under my gameinfo.txt at the mod directory under steam.
 
 use " sv_cheats 1" to enable cheats
 use "impulse 101" for all weapons and ammos
 use "ent_fire plyr_speed ModifySpeed 1.2" to change player speed

 (meeting with regan, kevin)
 2 difficulty levels for both experienced and non-experienced players
 parameters to change:
	- number of spawn points
	- base spawn rate
 3 conditions each one around 5min. adaptive player, adaptive npc and adaptive environment
 player: 
	- speed: regular and sprint standard should change
	- grenades: player can create grenades, one every ? seconds, and the rate of grenades creation can change.
	note: bullets should be weak enough to make it chanllenging, player has one infinite ammo machine gun which can launch grenades
 zombie:
	- walking speed
	- spawn rate
 environment:
	- health packs rate, there is a vending machine that generates health packs with a defined rate.
	- light, levels lighting can go high or low based on players feedback.

 note: log everything into a csv file, there might be a 1 or 2 minutes training.
