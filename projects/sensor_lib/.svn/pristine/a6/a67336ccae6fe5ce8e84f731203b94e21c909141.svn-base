MATLAB Notes

  Three m-files are provided:  

  1- mInitTTL.m
  2- ttltestNEW.m
  3- mDestroyTTL.m

ttltestNew is a "function", the other two are m-file scripts. They are called directly from the Matlab command window in the order specified above.

The mInitTTL.m script initializes the ActiveX object and returns a handle called TTLLive to the global workspace.  

The ttltestNEW function takes that handle as input parameter, connects to the encoder and starts to read and plot streaming data from channels C and D.   The output of the function is a data array (allData) containing the samples collected from both channels.   

The mDestroyTLL.m script will release the handle to the ActiveX object.
