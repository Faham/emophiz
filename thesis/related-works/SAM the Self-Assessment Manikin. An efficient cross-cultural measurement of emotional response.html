<div class="SideNotePara"><p>Although consumer research began focusing on emotional response to
advertising during the 1980s (Goodstein, Edell, and Chapman Moore, 1990;
Burke and Edell, 1989; Aaker, Stayman, and Vezina, 1988; Holbrook and Batra,
1988), perhaps one of the most practical measures of affective response has
only recently emerged. Part of the difficulty in developing measures of
emotional response stems from the complexity of emotion itself (Plummer and
Leckenby, 1985). Researchers have explored several different measurement
formats including: verbal self-reports (adjective checklists), physiological
techniques, photodecks, and dial-turning instruments.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>While many of these methods have been validated and accepted to some
degree, the research field is continually changing, creating the need for an
alternative measurement scale. Much of the recent evidence supports a
three-dimensional approach for accurately assessing emotional response, as
models with less than three dimensions may not accurately represent the
complete affective experience (Russell, 1989; Daly, Lancee, and Polivy, 1983;
Mehrabian and Russell, 1977; Havlena and Holbrook, 1986). The research of
Mehrabian and Russell produced evidence for three such dimensions through a
coupling of studies of nonverbal communication, the semantic differential,
and those by Bush (1973) with verbal-report indications for a larger number
of dimensions (Mehrabian and Russell, 1977). The results demonstrated that
all emotions can be accurately described in terms of three independent and
bipolar dimensions: pleasure-displeasure, degree of arousal, and
dominance-submissiveness. These elements are autonomous, as differing values
along any of these three dimensions can occur concurrently without affecting
one another (Mehrabian and Russell, 1977). Logically then, emotion is not
limited to isolated incidents, rather, it is ever-present. This theory
suggests that an individual is in a constant state of emotion, "a state
that can be described as a region within a three-dimensional space"
(Mehrabian and Russell, 1977). Such a technique could not only provide a
certain sense of depth to emotions, but could create a logical point of
origin for each descriptor placed on a feeling. In this manner, moods could
be plotted along a multidimensional continuum based on the three basic
emotions of pleasure, arousal, and dominance.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>The pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD) model has gained
widespread attention in advertising research (Havlena and Holbrook, 1986) and
has great potential for use in strategy formulation and copy development
(Zeitlin and Westwood, 1986). Researchers Havlena and Holbrook found PAD to
capture more information and to be "more useful than Plutchik's
scheme for positioning consumption experiences in an emotion space and for
developing experience-specific emotional profiles." The
three-dimensional model was also praised for permitting descriptions of
experiences in terms of more "basic, concrete" emotions as well as
in the more abstract dimensions (Havlena and Holbrook, 1986). To make the PAD
approach functional, by quickly establishing a response to a given stimulus;
applicable, by accurately reflecting a subject's full range of feelings;
and useful, by measuring affective responses among many diverse audiences
without linguistic interference, a visual rather than a verbal response
measure is needed.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) (Lang, 1985) presents a promising
solution to the problems that have been associated with measuring emotional
response to advertising (Morris et al., 1993; Morris and McMullen, 1993;
Morris and Waine, 1993; Morris, Bradley, and Wei, 1994; Morris, Sutherland,
Karrh, and Herr, 1994; Morris and Karrh, 1994). SAM visually represents
Mehrabian and Russell's three PAD dimensions [ILLUSTRATION FOR FIGURE 1
OMITTED] and was designed as an alternative to the sometimes cumbersome
verbal self-report measures (Lang, 1985).
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>SAM depicts each PAD dimension with a graphic character arrayed
along a continuous nine-point scale. For pleasure, SAM ranges from a smiling,
happy figure to a frowning, unhappy figure; for arousal, SAM ranges from
sleepy with eyes closed to excited with eyes open. The dominance scale shows
SAM ranging from a very small figure representing a feeling of being
controlled or submissive to a very large figure representing in-control or a
powerful feeling.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>SAM has been used in numerous psychophysiological studies since its
development. The correlations between scores obtained using SAM and those
obtained from Mehrabian and Russell's semantic differential procedure
were impressive for both pleasure (.94) and arousal (.94) and smaller but
still substantial for dominance (.66) (Lang, 1985). Similar results were
found by Morris and Bradley (1994) through a SAM reevaluation of 135 emotion
adjectives that were factor analyzed by Mehrabian and Russell.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>It is clear that visually oriented scales using a graphic character
eliminate the majority of problems associated with verbal measures or
nonverbal measures that are based on human photographs. In addition, subjects
can complete ratings on the SAM scales in less than 15 seconds, allowing
numerous stimuli to be tested in a short amount of time and causing less
respondent wearout than the verbal measures. Subjects have expressed greater
interest in SAM ratings versus verbal self-reports in a number of studies and
have stated that SAM is more likely to hold their attention (Lang, 1985). A
third advantage is that both children and adults readily identify with the
SAM figure and easily understand the emotional dimensions it represents
(Lang, 1985). Because SAM is a culture-free, language-free measurement it is
suitable for use in different countries and cultures (Bradley, Greenwald, and
Hamm, 1994; Morris, Bradley, and Wei, 1994).
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>SAM for Advertising Studies
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>The use of SAM to measure consumers' emotional response to
advertising messages has been demonstrated in a number of studies, both in
the United States and abroad. These include: responses by Americans and
Taiwanese to the same Globally Standardized Television Advertising (Morris,
Bradley, and Wei, 1994); a comparison of responses to storyboards, animatics,
and finished commercials (Morris and Waine, 1993); differences in responses
by creative strategy topology (Morris, Sutherland, Karrh, and Herr, 1994);
identifying multiple emotional responses within a single television
commercial (Morris and McMullen, 1993); and identifying gender differences
and the relative stability of emotional responses to competitive commercials
and public-service announcements across subjects and order of presentation
(Morris and Karrh, 1994).
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>In each study, SAM has provided interesting and consistent results.
For example, in the global study, findings indicate that emotional responses
to "standardized global advertising" are generally the same in the
United States and Taiwan. Cultural differences in emotional responses to
standardized global advertising seem to depend heavily on the ad execution.
The type of commercial, the spokespersons, and the storyline all appear to
affect the standardized spot's ability to produce consistent emotional
responses across cultures (Morris, Bradley, and Wei, 1994).
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>In the storyboard-animatic-finished commercial comparison, the
results indicate that overall, emotional-response scores for preproduction
versions are not significantly different from scores for finished
commercials. Significant differences were found for several ads in two
distinct groups: commercials which require enhanced audiovisual production
techniques to carry the main message and commercials for food products
(Morris and Waine, 1993).
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>Finally, two studies have found differences between genders and
between the sequencing of some advertisements or both. As expected, some
commercials produce different responses in males and females. The responses
are not necessarily better, just different. A few commercials seem to be
affected by the ads that proceed them. Again, the findings are not
necessarily better or worse, just different. These commercials seem to lack
the stability found in the unaffected ads.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>Application to Advertising Strategy and Evaluation
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>There are three methods for reporting SAM-PAD results for evaluating
ads or for providing affective insights for use in creative strategy and
product positioning. First, each ad or layout has pleasure-arousal-dominance
scores. The PAD ratings may be used to evaluate the advertiser's success
in reaching the desired levels of response or goals or may be compared to
other ad scores. Scores reported by subjects viewing a commercial from a
campaign may be compared to other ads or promotional devices in that campaign
or to norms for commercials from previous or competitive campaigns.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>Second, each ad has a place in a pleasure by arousal space. The
space may be divided into four quadrants for further analysis [ILLUSTRATION
FOR FIGURE 2 OMITTED].
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>Commercials may be examined for their quadrant position and compared
to ads with similar placement. Further examination could contrast and compare
ads within the quadrant or in a nearby space for similarities and differences
in creative strategy, executional variables, talent, semiotics, and product
positioning.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>Third, each of the 135 Mehrabian and Russell emotion adjectives has
been scored with SAM to obtain pleasure and arousal scores for each word. The
scores were compared to verbal analysis of the adjectives by Mehrabian and
Russell (1977). The analysis showed correlations of .93 for pleasure, .93 for
arousal, and .66 for dominance. The adjectives may be placed in the same
space occupied by the advertisements. Then, each advertisement is surrounded
by adjectives which may be used to describe the feelings of the viewers or
target audience after seeing that commercial. These adjectives may be useful
in refining creative strategy, choosing talent, or in selecting the
appropriate executional strategy. The pleasure by arousal space for ads of
several recently evaluated competitive products and public-service
announcements with the 135 emotion adjectives superimposed is presented in
Figure 3.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>Finally, the adjectives obtained from the advertisement-adjective
space may be used in a qualitative setting. After reporting their feelings,
subjects may be probed to determine the motives behind their responses.
Furthermore, a focus-group moderator would have insights into the feelings of
each participant and may use this information to compare to the verbalized
feelings. Often initial verbalized feelings are not the true feelings of the
participants and the disparity between their SAM-reported feelings and their
verbalized feelings may be explored. Moreover, differences in responses among
the participants may also be explored (Morris and Karrh, 1994).
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>SAM appears to be a very useful, easy to implement tool for
measuring affective responses with a wide range of applications in marketing
communications. Although all of the marketing communications research
applications reported here have been limited to evaluating television
commercials, SAM's potential is far greater. SAM may be used to evaluate
feelings for other promotional tools or for the brand itself. Some
interesting future analyses will include comparing feelings for the brand to
feelings obtained after watching the brand's commercial.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>Although SAM is ready for immediate application, future studies will
continue to examine SAM's role in marketing communications research. SAM
and the related tools of analysis Ad-SAM offer new insights into
consumers' feelings about the products they buy and the advertisements
they see. These methods appear to be more useful and telling than the
previous methods for measuring affective response to marketing
communications. The validation research for both SAM and PAD is extensive,
with the work of such researchers as Havlena, Holbrook, Mehrabian, and
Russell confirming the dimensions of PAD and numerous studies regarding SAM
in progress. At present, studies by Lang, Bradley, and Morris confirm the
reliability of SAM globally, on both the psychological and communication
levels. Research is currently underway to begin assessing SAM's relation
to brand awareness, differentiation, importance, satisfaction, preference,
intent to purchase, ad interest level, and believability. The function of
emotion in creating each of the above is invaluable to practitioners, both in
developing and evaluating successful products and campaigns

<div class="SideNotePara"><p>The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) is designed to measure emotional
response to advertising. It is a visual representation of the pleasure,
arousal and dominance (PAD) model introduced by Mehrabian and Russell (1977)
and is intended to serve as an alternative to verbal self-report measures,
which can be quite unwieldy at times. This test portrays each of the three
PAD dimensions with drawings of a character arranged along a continuous
nine-point scale. The depiction of the pleasure dimension ranges from a
smiling figure to a frowning one, while the portrayal of the arousal
dimension ranges from a sleepy character to one who is excited. The dominance
dimension is portrayed using figures ranging from a small and controlled
character to a big and powerful one. Three approaches to reporting SAM-PAD
results are discussed.
