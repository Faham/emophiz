In this chapter, related research to this work is being presented. It starts with introducing and reviewing common terminology used in the research on affect and emotion and the methods that have been used to measure affect and estimate emotion; And continues by presenting previous research in game balancing that inspired this work in its game experience enhancement study.

\section{Affect and Emotion}

In this section common terms used in the literature is introduced along with different ways these terms are often described.

\subsection{Terminology}

The terms \textit{affect} and \textit{emotion} are often used interchangeably and using these terms without any specific description highlighting their differences can be usually confusing. To avoid this confusion it is important to understand the distinction between these terms. In this thesis, \textit{affect} is

\section{Recognizing Emotions}

Using emotional responses to increase the level of users interaction with a real-time play technology requires an effective technique to identifying specific emotion states within an emotional space. Major existing emotion models in the psychology literature includes: basic emotion theory ~\cite{ekman1992argument, ekman1992there} , dimensional emotion theory ~\cite{lang1995emotion, russell1980circumplex} and models from appraisal theory (e.g.,~\cite{roseman2001model}) ~\cite{zhang2010service}

Basic emotion theory identifies anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise ~\cite{peter2006emotion} as the concise set of primary emotions. These are actually the least six universal categories researchers agreed upon ~\cite{zagalo2004story}. It also claims these primary emotions are distinguishable from each other and other affective phenomena ~\cite{dalgleish1999handbook}. On the other hand dimensional emotion theory argues that all emotional states reside in a two-dimensional space, defined by arousal and valence.

While there are various opinions on identifying emotional states, classification into discrete emotions ~\cite{dalgleish1999handbook}, or locating emotions along multiple axes ~\cite{russell1989affect, lang1995emotion}, both had limited success in using physiology to identify emotional states ~\cite{cacioppo2000psychophysiology}.

Lang used a 2-D space defined by arousal and valence (pleasure) (AV space) to classify emotions ~\cite{lang1995emotion}. Valence can be described as a subjective feeling of pleasantness or unpleasantness while arousal is the subjective state feeling activated or deactivated ~\cite{barrett1998discrete}. Using an arousal-valence space to create the Affect Grid, Russell believed that arousal and valence are cognitive dimensions of individual emotion states. Affect is a broad definition that includes feelings, moods, sentiments etc. and is commonly used to define the concept of emotion ~\cite{picard2003affective}. Russell's model has two "axes"that might be labeled as displeasure/pleasure (horizontal axis) and low/high arousal (vertical axis) It is not easy to map affective states into distinctive emotional states, However these models can provide a mapping between predefined states and the level of arousal and valence ~\cite{zagalo2004story}, Figure ~\ref{fig:russelavspace}.

Both mentioned models for identifying emotions convey some practical issues in emotion measurement. In a HCI context, the stimuli for potential emotions may vary less than in human-human interaction (e.g., participant verbal expressions and body language) ~\cite{zhang2010service} and also the combination of evoked emotions ~\cite{peter2006emotion}. However with help of physiological signals and the fuzzy logic in the model we are going to use, such issues with our dimentional emotion models would be minimized. Though it is anticipated to observe different range of evoked emotions while interacting with play technologies compared to interacting with other humans in daily life. ~\cite{zhang2010service}. However our dimensional emotion models suffers some other problems. One problems is that arousal and valence are not independent and one can impact the other ~\cite{mandryk2007fuzzy}. Continuously capturing emotional experiences in this applied setting is of its other hallmarks. Subjective measures based on dimensional emotion theory, such as the Affect Grid ~\cite{russell1989affect} and the Self-Assessment Manikin ~\cite{bradley1994measuring}, allow for quick assessments of user emotional experiences but they may aggregate responses over the course of many events ~\cite{zhang2010service}. This work uses Mandryk et al. version of AV space ~\cite{mandryk2007fuzzy}.

The Affective Gaming concept was first introduced by Wehrenberg, Charles through using Biofeedback to control a game based on relaxation level, it was the earliest research for correlating a game with biofeedback and after years of research the project was first implemented in 1984 for apple II computers, and the test results proved that human arousal level can actually be measured through GSR and used to control a game  ~\cite{wehrenberg1995willball}.

Playing video games as a kind of entertainment would help people to have new internal
experiences. The virtual world of video games let adults to play as new rolls and enjoy filling
their heads with new thoughts and emotions. Some people value
the sensation

Games are opportunities for development and design of environments therefore
the player can interactively experience various emotions and mental conditions.
This interactive experience in contrast to cinema
and other major types of entertainment is what makes them exceptional
