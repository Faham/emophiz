In this chapter, related research to this work is being presented. It starts with introducing and reviewing common terminology used in the research on affect and emotion and the methods that have been used to measure affect and emotion; And continues by presenting previous research in game balancing that inspired this work in its game experience enhancement study.

\section{Affect and Emotion}

In this section common terms used in the literature is introduced along with different ways these terms are often described.

\subsection{Terminology}

The terms \textit{affect} and \textit{emotion} are often used interchangeably and using these terms without any specific description highlighting their differences can be usually confusing. To avoid this confusion it is important to understand the distinction between these terms. In this thesis, \textit{affect} is used in a more general sense that encompasses emotions ~\cite{forgas1995mood} while \textit{emotions} are usually reactionary fealings often triggered by some particular cause either physical or cognitive and are short in duration; Individuals are usually aware of the presence of an emotion ~\cite{paiva2007affective}.

Classical attempts to describe emotion can be categorized into two major different approaches: Those that try to describe emotion by emphasizing its cognitive (mental) aspects and those that concentrate on its bodily (physical) aspects. Walter Cannon by suggesting emotion as an experience within the brain, independent of the sensations of the body ~\cite{cannon1927james} is usually credited for the cognitive approach. On the other hand the physical approach has largely been attributed to William James in which physiological responses (e.g. elevated heart rate) are the center of focus that occurs just prior or during an emotional episode ~\cite{paiva2007affective}.

In more recent approaches emotion has been considered as a combined result of cognitive and physiological changes simultaneously. ~\cite{paiva2007affective}. Body chemistry changes and thoughts can both contribute to the definition of emotions; As Schachter suggests emotion is our interpretation of a specific physiological reactions along with our mental situation that is labeled as an emotion (e.g. fear) ~\cite{schachter1964interaction}. In this thesis, \textit{emotional state} refers to the combinational internal dynamics (both cognitive and physiological) that are perceived by an individual during an emotional experience ~\cite{paiva2007affective}.

\section{Describing Emotion}

Identifying emotions by dividing them into discrete categories or assuming a continuous dimensional space in which emotions can be defined are two major approaches that the related research has gone into to describe emotions.

\subsection{Discrete Categories}

Suggested discrete categories in the categorical approach does not necessarily agree with one another. This approach, also known as the basic emotion theory largely relies on language in its mission to describe emotion; In fact, it begins by identifying specific labels people attach to different emotional episodes and then suggests categories of emotions. Examples of such labels (or categories) include excitement, anger, fear, sadness and happiness. Relying on language to describing emotions not only led suggested categories to vary across languages, but also within a language. The variability and disagreement in the literature suggests a lack for clear definitions or boundaries for these states, which has caused difficulties when comparing different research approaches. In-availability of specific categories in other languages also makes research using this approach difficult ~\cite{zimmermann2006extending}

Recent works on the basic emotion theory identifies anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise ~\cite{peter2006emotion} as the concise set of primary emotions. These are actually the least six universal categories researchers agreed upon ~\cite{zagalo2004story}. It also claims these primary emotions are distinguishable from each other and other affective phenomena ~\cite{dalgleish1999handbook}.

\subsection{Continuous Dimensions}

The dimensional emotion theory argues that all emotional states reside in a two-dimensional space, defined by arousal and valence. This approach described by Russell in ~\cite{russell2003core} introduces the idea of core affect to identify emotions. It holds core affect accountable for feelings triggered by specific events and describes it as being composed of two independent dimensions: arousal and valence. Figure ~\ref{fig:russel-av-space} illustrates the concept of arousal and valence space describing various emotions known as common emotion categories.

The energy or the degree of activation of an individual which brings a sense of mobilization is usually referred to as \textit{arousal}. The arousal state is physiological and psychological state of being reactive and responsive to a stimuli. The flight-or-fight response, as introduced in Cannon's theory ~\cite{stern2001psychophysiological} is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived threat or stimuli and focuses on the physiological changes that occur in the body during these situations. Different qualities of arousal are usually studied as low (e.g. sleepiness) to high (e.g. excitement).

Valence as often used in psychology particularly in study of emotions, means the intrinsic attractiveness (positive valence) or aversiveness (negative valence) of an event or situation ~\cite{frijda1986emotions}. However in many related studies of emotion, the term is also used to identify popular emotions by their negative or positive impressions. Emotions with lower valence are those that are less desired such as anger and fear, and emotions with higher valence are those that are more desired such as joy and happiness.

Lang used a 2-D space defined by arousal and valence (pleasure) (AV space) to classify emotions ~\cite{lang1995emotion}. Valence is described as a subjective feeling of pleasantness or unpleasantness while arousal is the subjective state feeling activated or deactivated ~\cite{barrett1998discrete}. Using an arousal-valence space to create the Affect Grid, Russell believed that arousal and valence are cognitive dimensions of individual emotion states. Affect is a broad definition that includes feelings, moods, sentiments etc. and is commonly used to define the concept of emotion ~\cite{picard2003affective}. Russell's model has two axes that might be labeled as displeasure/pleasure (horizontal axis) and low/high arousal (vertical axis) It is not easy to map affective states into distinctive emotional states, However these models can provide a mapping between predefined states and the level of arousal and valence ~\cite{zagalo2004story}, Figure ~\ref{fig:russel-av-space}.

\section{Recognizing Emotions}

While there are various opinions on identifying emotional states, classification into discrete emotions ~\cite{dalgleish1999handbook}, or locating emotions along multiple axes ~\cite{russell1989affect, lang1995emotion}, both had limited success in using physiology to identify emotional states ~\cite{cacioppo2000psychophysiology}.

In this work, both the categorical and dimensional approaches are used for developed models. The model developed for capturing emotional state responses is coupled with gathered subjective emotional experiences of our participants based on a categorical approach. Using categorical approach when collecting emotional experiences subjectively is the most practical method, as it is far easier for participants to communicate in a language that they can understand (emotional categories rather than the degree of arousal or valence) to describe their emotional state best. However although we did not want to use a data collection process that require the participants to learn new terminologies and describe their emotional state with unfamiliar terms, participants have been introduced to arousal, valence and dominance concepts. Given example emotions for different levels of these variables participants described their affect state by choosing images based on these concepts. The developed model for the affect space uses the dimensional model as in Figure ~\ref{fig:russel-av-space} to provide a mapping between the original emotional categories and a dimensional space. These models are further elaborated in Chapter ~\ref{chap:impl}.

Both mentioned models for identifying emotions convey some practical issues in emotion measurement. In a HCI context, the stimuli for potential emotions may vary less than in human-human interaction (e.g., participant verbal expressions and body language) ~\cite{zhang2010service} and also the combination of evoked emotions ~\cite{peter2006emotion}. However with help of physiological signals and the fuzzy logic in the model we are going to use, such issues with our dimensional emotion models would be minimized. Though it is anticipated to observe different range of evoked emotions while interacting with play technologies compared to interacting with other humans in daily life. ~\cite{zhang2010service}. Our dimensional emotion models also suffers some other problems. One problems is that arousal and valence are not independent and one can impact the other ~\cite{mandryk2007fuzzy}. Continuously capturing emotional experiences in this applied setting is of its other hallmarks. Subjective measures based on dimensional emotion theory, such as the Affect Grid ~\cite{russell1989affect} and the Self-Assessment Manikin ~\cite{bradley1994measuring}, allow for quick assessments of user emotional experiences but they may aggregate responses over the course of many events ~\cite{zhang2010service}. This work uses Mandryk et al. version of AV space ~\cite{mandryk2007fuzzy}.

There are many visible features that can be observed and measured in our everyday interactions to be considered as emotional indicators. Many different emotional indicators that have been studied to determine affect include facial expressions, gestures, postures, language, pressure, and pupil dilation ~\cite{picard2003affective}. Facial expressions for example can help us to figure out whether someone is distracted, frustrated or happy. Researchers have used many sophisticated face-tracking software to analyze facial expressions in order to find out emotional state of the user ~\cite{partala2006real, sebe2006emotion}. Some researches have extended this work by identifying facial points that undergo significant thermal changes with a change in expression and resulted it as a person-independent classification to do affect interpretation using infrared measurement of facial skin temperature variations ~\cite{khan2006automated}. Other recent works has pushed the borders even further by using observable facial features that are only visible to machines. Work by Takano et al has shown how to measure heart rate based on a partial average image brightness of the subject's skin using consecutively captured time-lapsed images ~\cite{takano2007heart}.

Many physiological changes in the body occurring during an emotional episode is not visible to another person. Many researchers have considered using physiological data to identify emotional states. It was first speculated by William James to use patterns of physiological responses to recognize emotion ~\cite{cacioppo2000psychophysiology}. Although this approach does not consider the individual's psyche and mind state to identify emotions but many evidences suggest that physiological data sources can differentiate among some emotions ~\cite{ekman1983autonomic}. Picard et al. performed a feature-based recognition of eight emotional states from GSR, EMG of the jaw, BVP and respiration over multiple days ~\cite{picard2001toward}. Their work presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional states partially corrected for day-to-day differences and provides an 81\% accuracy on recognizing eight emotional states. Mandryk et al. shown how to measure and use physiological metrics such as galvanic skin response (GSR), respiration, electrocardiography (EKG), and electromyography of the jaw (EMG) as indicators of participants' affective states while playing video games ~\cite{mandryk2007fuzzy}.

\section{Measuring Affect}
When evaluating affective interfaces and interactions in HCI, one of the most important and primary challenges is to detect affect state of the user. measuring affect can be addressed under different titles such as sensing, detection or recognition. However we chose to use `measurement' to signify all these different expressions. Classically there are two major approaches for affect measurement: physiological measures and self-report. In the following a brief description of self-report approach continues with a look into today most popular physiological measures that are used in this work.

\subsection{Self-Report}
Self-report measures is to figure out the emotional state of an individual by directly questioning the individual. This is usually done through a familiar language and vocabulary, or sometimes using images that carry a common meaning within different languages and cultures. This is in fact trying to find out about an individual's emotional state through his or her verbal descriptions, and it can have different forms like rating scales, standardized checklists, questionnaires, semantic graphical differentials and projective methods. Self-report is maybe the simplest and easiest way too approach the issue of affect measurement, and it suffers some major weaknesses. Criticisms of self-report methods include the possibility that they draw attention to what the experimenter is trying to measure, that they fail to measure mild (low intensity) emotions, and that they are not construct valid ~\cite{isen2007some}.

\subsubsection{Game Engagement/Experience Questionnaire}
The Game Engagement/Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) measures gamer's engagement during a video game play ~\cite{brockmyer2009development}. This questionnaire consists of 19 items scored on a Likert scale. This questionnaire specifically measures engagement level as absorption, flow, presence and immersion. Cronbach’s alpha for the current 19-item version of the GEQ is .85. The Rasch estimate of person reliability (the Rasch analog to Cronbach’s alpha) for the 19-item version is .83 and the item reliability is .96 ~\cite{brockmyer2009development}. In this work, this questionnare is used as a subjective measure in chapter ~\ref{chap:exprm}.

\subsubsection{Intrinsic Motivation Inventory}
The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) utilizes several sub-scales that relate to user experience during a targeted activity ~\cite{ryan1983relation}. This questionnaire is a useful measure for interactive technologies such as games and has been utilies in several studies. For this study the Interest-Enjoyment sub-scale that contains 5 questions, the Effort sub-scale that contains 4 questions and the Pressure-Tension sub-scale that contains 4 questions will be used. The interest-enjoyment sub-scale is associated with self-reported intrinsic motivation. More information about this questionnaire and the experiment can be found in chapter ~\ref{chap:exprm}

\subsubsection{Player Experience of Need Satisfaction}
Player Experience of Need Satisfaction model (PENS) introduces a practical theory of player motivation that has meaningfully contributed to developers' understanding of what really satisfies players. This work done by Immersyve ~\cite{rigby2007pens} provides a practical testing methodology and analytic approach with proven value. Numerous data demonstrate competencce, autonomy and relatedness at the heart of player's fun, enjoyment and valuing of games, PENS outlines and measures these three intrinsic psychological needs through 21 items scored on a Likert scale ~\cite{rigby2007pens}. PENS model can significantly predict pisitive experiential and commercial outcomes through collecting data on how these needs are being satisfied, in many cases this has happened much more strongly than more traditional measures of fun and enjoyment. It is important to note the plausible predictive values demonstrated by PENS model repeatedly have been done regardless of genre, platform or even the individual preferences of players ~\cite{rigby2007pens}.

\subsubsection{Self-Assessment-Manikin Arousal Scales}
The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) ~\cite{lang1985cognitive} presents a promising solution to the problems that have been associated with measuring emotional response in Mehrabian and Russell's three PAD dimensions ~\cite{russell1977evidence}. SAM takes a visual approach to design an alternative to the sometimes-combersome verbal self-report measures ~\cite{lang1985cognitive}.

\img

{sam-russell}

SAM has been used in numerous psychophysiological studies since its development. The correlations between scores obtained using SAM and those obtained from Mehrabian and Russell's semantic differential procedure were impressive for both pleasure (.94) and arousal (.94) and smaller but still substantial for dominance (.66) ~\cite{lang1985cognitive}. Similar results were found by Morris and Bradley ~\cite{morris1995observations} through a SAM reevaluation of 135 emotion adjectives that were factor analyzed by Mehrabian and Russell.

By visually oriented scales and a graphic character it is clear that SAM eliminate the majority of problems associated with verbal measures or nonverbal measures that are based on human photographs. The simple and visual scales help individuals complete ratings on the SAM scales in less than 15 seconds, and therefore this allowes numerous stimuli to be tested in a short amount of time and causing less respondent wearout than the verbal measures. Subjects have expressed greater interest in SAM ratings versus verbal self-reports in a number of studies and have stated that SAM is more likely to hold their attention ~\cite{lang1985cognitive}. A third advantage is that both children and adults readily identify with the SAM figure and easily understand the emotional dimensions it represents ~\cite{lang1985cognitive}. Because SAM is a culture-free, language-free measurement it is suitable for use in different countries and cultures ~\cite{bradley1993affective}.

\subsection{Physiological Measures}

Physiological signals such as facial expressions, vocal tone, skin conductance, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, pupillary dilation, electroencephalography (EEG) or muscle action, being looked into to determine the intensity and quality of and individual's internal affective state are usually referred to as physiological measures. As for self-report measures, there are concers with physiological measures that usually relate to (1) setup, invasiveness, and attendance that the involved devices require and (2) the association of specific physical responses with a particular type of emotion because of individual variability ~\cite{depaula2005cognitive}

At the following a number of most popular physiological measures also used in this work are shortly introduced.

\subsubsection{Galvanic Skin Response}
Skin conductance, also known as galvanic skin response (GSR) or electrodermal response (EDR), is a method of investigating electrical conductance of the skin. This feature varies depending on the moisture of the skin by sweat. The fact that sweat is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system ~\cite{seiger2002essentials} makes this measure quite helpful to investigate affect state of an individual. In other words, skin conductance can be used as an indication of physiological arousal. The sweat gland activity in certain areas of the skin such as finger tips is largely dependent to sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system; And for example it would be increased if the person is highly aroused and therefore, skin conductance would change. Thus, skin conductance is a good measure of emotional and sympathetic responses ~\cite{carlson2013physiology}.

Galvanic skin response can be measured by looking at changes of galvanic skin resistance and galvanic skin potential. Galvanic skin resistance refers to measured electrical resistance between two electrodes while a weak current is passing through them. These electrodes are usually placed on certain areas of skin for about an inch apart. Galvanic skin potential is the measured voltage between two electrodes while no external current being applied. This potential is measured by connecting electrodes to voltage amplifiers. The recorded resistance and voltage varies dependent on the emotional state of the subject ~\cite{pflanzer2013galvanic}.

The relation between sympathetic activity and emotional arousal due to a stimuli can be easily detected through the response of the skin. The subtle changes in skin conductance, when the device is correctly calibrated, can be measured and rationalized. Though identification of particular specifications of the emotional episode merely by looking at these skin conductance changes seems to be impossible ~\cite{pflanzer2013galvanic}.

\subsubsection{Heart Rate}
Easiest way to measure heart rate, is by finding the pulse of the heart by looking at any region of body where the artery's pulsation is easily detectable at the surface of skin; By pressuring that region with index and middle fingers against the underlying structures such as bone the pulse of the heart can be detected. The neck under the corner of the jaw, the wrist and the upper arm are best places to find the blood vessels close to the skin's surface and therefore easily feel the pulse of the heart when blood is pumped through the body.

Electrocardiograph or ECG (also abbreviated EKG) is the device usually used for more precise determination of heart's pulse. This device is quite popular in clinical settings for continious monitoring of heart, particularly in critical care settings such as ICU. EKG uses electrodes placed on the surface of the skin to measure the electrical activity of the heart. Usual places to attach these electrodes are on the chest, forearm or legs. Conductive gels should be applied on the bare skin before attaching these electrodes, also there should be no gap between the electrodes and the skin so the area usually needs to be shaved and must be free of hair to prevent interferences with the sensors ~\cite{stern2001psychophysiological}.

On an ECG the heart rate is measured using the R wave to R wave interval (RR interval). Accurate R peak detection is essential in signal processing equipment for heart rate measurement ~\cite{pise2011thinkquest}, in this work this has been done by looking at signal derivatives after applyting passes of smoothing to the signal data.

Blood Volume Pulse sensor (BVP or photoplethysmograph) and Pulse oximetry are also another comparatively non-invasive methods for monitoring an individual's pulse. In BVP an infra-red beam in bounced against a skin surface and measures the puls by looking at the amount of reflected light. The reflected amount of light would change by passing through different volume of blood in the skin. Therefore when there is larger volume of blood in the skin, due it its red color it absorbs larger amount of other colors and more red color would be reflected, but when the skin does not contain large volume of blood more amount of other colors are reflected. Using the BVP signal in addition to the heart rate the software can usually also calculate the inter-beat interval. The amplitude of the BVP deviation can also be a useful measure. Heart Rate Variability can also be calculated with the BVP.

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the phenomenon of variation in the time interval between heartbeats and therefore the heart rate. It is measured by lookin at variation in beat-to-beat interval. HRV is an interesting measure to look at in the field of psychophysiology. HRV is usually correlated to emotional arousal. %TODO: paraphrase the rest here

%%http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability
p High-frequency (HF) activity has been found to decrease under conditions of acute time pressure and emotional strain[6] and elevated state anxiety,[7] presumably related to focused attention and motor inhibition.[7] HRV has been shown to be reduced in individuals reporting a greater frequency and duration of daily worry.[8] In individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), HRV and its HF component (see below) is reduced compared to controls whilst the low-frequency (LF) component is elevated. Furthermore, unlike controls, PTSD patients demonstrated no LF or HF reactivity to recalling a traumatic event.[9]

The background music is neutral and sounds vary with the circumstances.

p Due to our findings, the noninvasive and well-accepted procedure and the need for more knowledge, we conclude that analyzing HRV seems to be a useful approach for fu- ture studies on the impact of violent contents in television games.

\subsubsection{Facial Electromyography}

%% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_electromyography
p Facial Electromyography (fEMG) refers to an electromyography (EMG) technique that measures muscle activity by detecting and amplifying the tiny electrical impulses that are generated by muscle fibers when they contract.
p It primarily focuses on two major muscle groups in the face, the corrugator supercilii group which is associated with frowning and the zygomaticus major muscle group which is associated with smiling.[1][2]

p Facial EMG has been studied to assess its utility as a tool for measuring emotional reaction.[3] Studies have found that activity of the corrugator muscle, which lowers the eyebrow and is involved in producing frowns, varies inversely with the emotional valence of presented stimuli and reports of mood state. Activity of the zygomatic major muscle, which controls smiling, is said to be positively associated with positive emotional stimuli and positive mood state.

p Facial EMG has been used as a technique to distinguish and track positive and negative emotional reactions to a stimulus as they occur.[4] A large number of those experiments have been conducted in controlled laboratory environments using a range of stimuli, e.g., still pictures, movie clips and music pieces.

p It has also been used to investigate emotional responses in individuals with autism spectrum disorders.[5]

p In 2012 Durso et al. were able to show that facial EMG could be used to detect confusion, both in participants who admitted being confused and in those who did not, suggesting that it could be used as an effective addition to a sensor suite as a monitor of loss of understanding or loss of situation awareness.[6]

p Gaming and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) - Ravaja,[9] Hazlett[11] and Mandryk[10] used facial EMG techniques to demonstrate that positive and negative emotions can be measured in real time during video game play. The emotional profiling of games give a useful evaluation of a game's impact on a player, how compelling they find the game, how the game measures up to other games in its genre, and how the different elements of the game enhance or detract from the game's approach to engaging the player.[12]

One of the major problems with using physiological devices to measure affect is the intrusive nature of the technology. Although physiological sensors can provide lots of useful data about the user in the course of interaction, but  it is usually quite limiting to use sensors in many ways. Sensors usually need special attention in terms of their placement and connection to the target, particularly because the target is sometimes moving. Some sensors are inherently sensitive to movement and might generate a large amount of noisy signals which needs to be detected and filtered out by the software analyzing the signal. On the other hand some of the sensors such as the respiration sensor can hardly be designed for realistic casual interactions. Furthermore, the presence of an unusual device attached to the user might itself has some influence on user's emotional experience.

There are some physiological approaches that let us detect affect states with less limitations. Wireless and wearable devices or even devices with no need to have any contact with the participants such as thermal cameras to identify increased blood flow in particular regions of the skin are of this category ~\cite{puri2005stresscam}. However in the case of thermal cameras, this technology although not as obtrusive as other physiological approaches such as GSR sensors, but still requires a quite expensive device which is not usually found in typical computer settings. This main drawback of expensive technologies is still typical of many other physiological sensors such as GSR sensors. The requirement for such expensive specialized equipment limits the applicability of widespread adoption of this sensors.
