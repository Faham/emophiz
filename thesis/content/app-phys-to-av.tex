The following 22 rules were used as described in Section ~\ref{subsec:fuzzi} to transform physiological variables into arousal-valence space:

\lstset{emph={%
    if, is, and, then%
    },emphstyle={\color{blue}\bfseries}%
}%

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none]
if (GSR is high)                             then (arousal is high)
if (GSR is midHigh)                          then (arousal is midHigh)
if (GSR is midLow)                           then (arousal is midLow)
if (GSR is low)                              then (arousal is low)
if (HR is low)                               then (arousal is low)
if (HR is high)                              then (arousal is high)
if (EMGfrown is high)                        then (valence is veryLow)
if (EMGfrown is mid)                         then (valence is low)
if (EMGsmile is mid)                         then (valence is high)
if (EMGsmile is high)                        then (valence is veryHigh)
if (GSR is low)       and (HR is high)       then (arousal is midlow)
if (GSR is high)      and (HR is low)        then (arousal is midhigh)
if (GSR is high)      and (HR is mid)        then (arousal is high)
if (GSR is midHigh)   and (HR is mid)        then (arousal is midHigh)
if (GSR is midLow)    and (HR is mid)        then (arousal is midLow)
if (EMGsmile is low)  and (EMGfrown is low)  then (valence is neutral)
if (EMGsmile is high) and (EMGfrown is low)  then (valence is veryHigh)
if (EMGsmile is high) and (EMGfrown is mid)  then (valence is high)
if (EMGsmile is low)  and (EMGfrown is high) then (valence is veryLow)
if (EMGsmile is mid)  and (EMGfrown is high) then (valence is low)
if (EMGsmile is low)  and (EMGfrown is low) and (HR is low)  then (valence is low)
if (EMGsmile is low)  and (EMGfrown is low) and (HR is high) then (valence is high)
