The following 22 rules were used as described in Section ~\ref{subsec:fuzzi} to transform physiological variables into arousal-valence space:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
if (GSR      is high     )                        then (arousal is high     )
if (GSR      is mid-high )                        then (arousal is mid-high )
if (GSR      is mid-low  )                        then (arousal is mid-low  )
if (GSR      is low      )                        then (arousal is low      )
if (HR       is low      )                        then (arousal is low      )
if (HR       is high     )                        then (arousal is high     )
if (EMGfrown is high     )                        then (valence is very low )
if (EMGfrown is mid      )                        then (valence is low      )
if (EMGsmile is mid      )                        then (valence is high     )
if (EMGsmile is high     )                        then (valence is very high)
if (GSR      is low      ) and (HR is high)       then (arousal is midlow   )
if (GSR      is high     ) and (HR is low )       then (arousal is midhigh  )
if (GSR      is high     ) and (HR is mid )       then (arousal is high     )
if (GSR      is mid-high ) and (HR is mid )       then (arousal is mid-high )
if (GSR      is mid-low  ) and (HR is mid )       then (arousal is mid-low  )
if (EMGsmile is low      ) and (EMGfrown is low ) then (valence is neutral  )
if (EMGsmile is high     ) and (EMGfrown is low ) then (valence is very high)
if (EMGsmile is high     ) and (EMGfrown is mid ) then (valence is high     )
if (EMGsmile is low      ) and (EMGfrown is high) then (valence is very low )
if (EMGsmile is mid      ) and (EMGfrown is high) then (valence is low      )
if (EMGsmile is low      ) and (EMGfrown is low ) and (HR is low)  then (valence is low)
if (EMGsmile is low      ) and (EMGfrown is low ) and (HR is high) then (valence is high)
