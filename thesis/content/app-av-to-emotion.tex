The following 67 rules were used as described in Section ~\ref{subsec:fuzzi} to convert arousal and valence into boredom, challenge, excitement, frustration, and fun:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If (arousal is not veryLow) and (valence is midHigh) then (fun is low)
\item If (arousal is not low) and (valence is midHigh) then (fun is low)
\item If (arousal is not veryLow) and (valence is high) then (fun is medium)
\item If (valence is veryHigh) then (fun is high)
