=== Troubleshooting ===

PROBLEM: When building the project, if you get an error that reads "Interop type 'TTLLiveCtrlLib.TTLLiveClass' cannot be embedded. Use the applicable interface instead."
SOLUTION: Make sure the reference to TTLAPI.manifest in the SensorLib.ThoughtTechnologies project is correct.
